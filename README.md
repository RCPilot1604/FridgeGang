# FreshTrack

FreshTrack is a mobile application designed to help you keep track of your groceries, reduce food waste, and maintain an organized refrigerator. By scanning QR codes, you can effortlessly add items with their expiry dates, ensuring you always know what's fresh.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

- **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the repository.
- **Node.js and npm:** Node.js version 16 or later is recommended. This installation includes `npm` (Node Package Manager). Your `npm` version must be **10.5.0** or higher.
- **Expo Go App:** Install the Expo Go application on your mobile device.
  - [Download for iOS (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)
  - [Download for Android (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine and mobile device.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RCPilot1604/FridgeGang.git

## ðŸ“± Using the App

### Adding New Items

You can add one or more items to your fridge list by scanning a specially formatted QR code.

2.  This will open your phone's camera.
3.  Scan a valid QR code to add new items. For a quick test, use the image displayed below.

### Creating Your Own QR Codes

To add your own groceries, you need to generate a QR code containing the item data in a specific JSON format.

1.  Go to a QR code generator website, for example, [The QR Code Generator](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/).
2.  Choose the **"Text"** or **"Plain Text"** option.
3.  Paste a JSON array into the text field. The JSON must follow the structure below.

#### JSON Data Structure

The QR code must contain a JSON array where each object represents a single grocery item.

| Field           | Type                | Description                                                   | Required |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| `item_name`     | `String`            | The name of the grocery item.                                 | Yes      |
| `purchase_date` | `String (ISO 8601)` | The date and time of purchase (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`). | Yes      |
| `expiry_date`   | `String (ISO 8601)` | The expiration date of the item.                              | Yes      |
| `category`      | `String`            | The category of the item (e.g., "Dairy", "Meat").             | Yes      |

#### Example JSON Payload

Here is an example of a valid JSON array that you can use to generate a QR code.

```json
[
  {
    "item_name": "Bavarian Pretzels",
    "purchase_date": "2025-06-26T16:45:00Z",
    "expiry_date": "2025-07-03T12:00:00Z",
